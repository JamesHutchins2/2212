## UI

I am not too sure what to put here. I am unaware of how front end libraries will work but:

1. Determine libraries to use -> laila
2. Create a basic UI -> laila
3. Create connection mechanism -> michelle
4. create document stats part -> michelle


## RunTime


1. Manage file -> Jessica
2. Parallelize -> Jessica
3. Handle Click/Action -> Nouran + UI team
4. Loops -> TBD (this will be very variable and dependant on the other classes. I can make the base stuff but everyone will be changing )
5. Click Integration (Entire team this will really depend on what called functions are at play) Likley major for UI so michelle and laila
